          From the Mass Save website: “Through ConnectedSolutions, residents
          receive incentives for lowering and/or shifting electricity usage
          during times of peak demand (like hotter days during the summer).
          Residents will receive $275 per kilowatt (kW) for a battery’s average
          contribution during summer events.
          <br />
          By enrolling your home battery system, you will earn incentives for
          allowing your Mass Save Sponsor to draw energy stored in your battery
          during times of peak electricity demand.Your Mass Save Sponsor will
          automatically send a signal to your system no more than 60 times per
          summer, with each event lasting a maximum of three hours. Summer
          events will occur on non-holidays between June 1 and September 30,
          between the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.”
